My task for this Programming Exercise was to achieve a similar behavior as HOS08A by deploying a newly built container, flask_docker_pe_image, with a minor modifications to the configuration YAML and HTML file.

1.	Create duplicate of the “hos_config.yaml” file and change file name to “pe_config.yaml” in the \ai510-summer-2024-hos08-MissVz\kub_config\ folder
2.	Follow around “!!!! Updated this for PE” comment to review where the edits are required.
3.	For the image, I used my own docker image with a new name, flask_docker_pe_image, and server content, "My PE prediction result: " and <h1> This is Flask PE app </h1>, instead of the image used in HOS08A.
