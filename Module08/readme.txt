Your task for this Programming Exercise is to achieve a similar behavior as HOS08A but deploy a newly built container with a minor modification to the configuration YAML file.

1.	Create duplicate of the “hos_config.yaml” file and change file name to “pe_config.yaml”
2.	From the copied “hos_config.yaml” file, follow around “!!!! Edit this for PE” comment to review where the edits are required.
3.	For the image, use your own docker image with a new name and server content instead of the image used in HOS08A.
