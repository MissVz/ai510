2. This PyTorch notebook is all about building and training a SuperResolutionNet model using layers like convolution and ReLU. It includes preprocessing steps for input images, exporting the trained model to ONNX format for interoperability and optimization, and testing it with ONNXRuntime to ensure the results match the PyTorch output.
