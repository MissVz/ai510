CS622 PE10 BFS & Recursion (accidently placed CS622 files in ai510 folder on GitHub)
1. PE10_island_counter_main.py
2. PE10_island_counter_VElze.py
3. A recursive function would call itself over and over until every piece of land is discovered. I would still start by finding and “visiting” the first coordinates of land. My recursive function would take those first coordinates and check its neighbors for land (). Then it would call itself to check each neighbor the same way. Repeat until all cells have been “visited”.
